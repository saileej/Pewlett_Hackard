# Pewlett Hackard

**Overview**
The purpose of this challenge was to determine which employees at Pewlett Hackard, a large corporation, will be retiring in the coming years, and therefore how many new employees must be hired.  Employees who were born between the years 1952 and 1955 and hired between 1985 and 1988 are "soon to be retirees".  In addition, Pewlett Hackard plans to designate employees born in the year 1965 as mentors for new hires.  A second database analysis was conducted to determine which employees are eligible to serve as mentors.
